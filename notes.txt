These tests can be unreliable when run from a laptop.
In a hotel (or Heathrow Terminal 5) with flaky wifi I get this...

Selenium::WebDriver::Error::ScriptTimeOutError: timeout: cannot determine loading status
from timeout: Timed out receiving message from renderer: -0.004

But when I the tests are run on Travis they pass ok.

This looks network related...

In this situation the best option is to turn off wifi.

Missing tests
o) reverting
o) forking
o) create a session from a custom start-point
